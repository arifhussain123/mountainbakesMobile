 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The ESC/POS packages on npm are either bound to a transport (they want to own
 * the Bluetooth socket, which `specs/NativeThermalPrinter.ts` owns) or built on
 * Node's `Buffer` and `iconv-lite`, neither of which exists in Hermes. What is
 * actually needed is a few dozen bytes of Epson's command set and a text
 * encoder, and it is all in this file — pure functions over `number[]`, so the
 * whole receipt can be asserted in a unit test without a printer.
 *
 * A command is a byte sequence. `[0x1B, 0x40]` is "reset". Nothing here is
 * device-specific: these are the standard Epson commands the Black Copper
 * BC-89AC and every other printer of its class implement. What IS device
 * specific — how many characters fit across the roll — lives in
 * `profiles.ts`.
